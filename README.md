## ⚠️ Important Disclaimer

This project automates a user account using a **user token**. This is in **direct violation of Discord's Terms of Service** and can result in your account being disabled. Use this software at your own risk. For a TOS-compliant alternative, consider building a Discord bot using an official bot token and the Discord API. This is intended as Educational Purposes ONLY!

## ℹ️ Features

*   **AI-Powered Replies:** Leverages the Google Gemini API to generate context-aware, human-like responses.
*   **Customizable Personality:** Define a custom personality for the bot at startup (e.g., "sarcastic," "overly enthusiastic") to tailor its tone and style.
*   **Realistic Behavior:**
    *   **"Typing" Indicator:** The bot will appear to be typing before it sends a message.
    *   **Dynamic Delay:** The wait time before replying is based on the length of the generated message.
    *   **Randomized Replies:** The bot will randomly decide whether to send a message as a direct reply to a user or as a new, standalone message in the channel.
*   **Channel Monitoring:** Actively monitors one or more specified Discord channels for new messages.
*   **Stateful Memory:** Remembers which messages it has replied to (using a local `db.json` file) to avoid duplicates, even after restarting.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

*   **Runtime:** Node.js (v18+)
*   **API:** Google Gemini API
*   **Dependencies:**
    *   `node-fetch`: For making HTTP requests to the Discord and Gemini APIs.
    *   `inquirer`: For interactive command-line prompts to gather configuration.
    *   `lowdb`: For a simple, local JSON database to store state.
    *   `dotenv`: For managing environment variables.
